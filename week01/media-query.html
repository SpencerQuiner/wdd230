            <h2>Mosiah 16:6-9</h2>
            <p> 6 And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though they had already come, there could have been no redemption.

                7 And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have broken the bands of death that the grave should have no victory, and that death should have no sting, there could have been no resurrection.
                
                8 But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ.
                
                9 He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death.</p>
